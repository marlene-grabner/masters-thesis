# masters-thesis
Questions:
- The original data I got from paper etc. - how do I present this? probably not at all? because then I would need to cite and how?
- What do I do with the many results files I have (especially the distance files) - github truncates to 1000 per folder anyways, but I feel like even that is too many - just put like 5? of coure then not all graphs will be created if one were to run the code
